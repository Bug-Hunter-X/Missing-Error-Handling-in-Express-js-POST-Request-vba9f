# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for POST requests.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of an Express app that is vulnerable to this issue.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Bug

The `bug.js` application accepts POST requests to `/users`, expecting a user object in the request body.  However, it doesn't handle cases where the request body is missing or invalid.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as crashes or silent failures.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file addresses this issue by adding comprehensive error handling.  It checks for missing or invalid request bodies and returns appropriate error responses to the client.  This ensures robust behavior in the face of unexpected input.
